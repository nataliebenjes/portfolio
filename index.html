          <p>This site included my first use of <span class="elementHighlight"><em>&lt;span&gt;</em></span>. My co-author and I used a span to style  text that covered less than one line of code, such as the grey <span class="elementHighlight"><em>&lt;span&gt;</em></span> highlight in this paragraph</p>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/nataliebenjes/bloggingwebsite">bloggingwebsite</a></li>

    <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona, I spent my summers inside making art, playing video games, and participating in my High School's marching band. I graduated from Northern Arizona University with a Bachelors of Science in Biology and minor in Music. Post graduation, I left Arizona to travel by taking seasonal jobs including but not limited to; raft guiding, outdoor education, a salmon hatchery, and tourism. Then I moved to Eugene, OR and accepted a positionas a Lab Technician, performing QA testing for a Dietary Supplement manufacurer. I was very happy to gain experience in a technical position, and to work somewhere long-term. However, I have pivoted to programming because I am seeking more daily challenge, variety, and higher salary.</p>
